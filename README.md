# A-Path-finding-Visualizer
A python visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm using Pygame and TKinter. It allows users to pick a start and end point and view the process of finding the shortest path.

The A-star algorithm is employed here to determine the  shortest path between two nodes in a 2-D grid, with the option of placing the obstacles given to the user. Based on A-star's heuristic  function, different  paths  are traversed and the final path is determined using backtracking. 


The project thus helps in visually interpreting how the A-Star algorithm functions.
